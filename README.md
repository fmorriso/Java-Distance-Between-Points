# Java Distance Between Points

Compute the distance between two points by using the approximation of Earth's mean radius of 6731 kilometers
and the assumption Earth is a perfect sphere.

## Distance between two lat/lon information

The distance between Big Ben in London (51.5007째 N, 0.1246째 W) and The Statue of Liberty in
New York (40.6892째 N, 74.0445째 W) is 5574.8 km.
This is not the exact measurement because the
formula assumes that the Earth is a perfect sphere when in fact it is an oblate spheroid.
